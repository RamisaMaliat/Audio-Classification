The project is done by taking sounds from 10 different genres using .wav files. This work mainly focuses on the preprocessing of using audio/sound and how it can be implemented. The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) technique is used in the preprocessing step to extract necessary information from the audio signal. After preprocessing the data in 6 steps, two models were proposed to classify the audio data into 10 different classes where one is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and another is a Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) model. Finally these models were compared with each other.
